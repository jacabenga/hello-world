# hello-world
I am getting started on GitHub. Here I go.

Good noon everybody!

This is Jaime, writing to you from Earth, lat. 55.34°N, 12.35°E.
I do not have a fixed roadmap, but my general plan is contributing to saving life on Earth from the behaviour of some powerful humans.
I am working on it. Don't stress me out, ok?
